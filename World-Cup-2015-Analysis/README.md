This project was based on data collected from world cup 2015. Data visualisation and analysis has been done using excel. Here we  can see data of each match, highest run scorer, highest wicket taker, man of the match, winning team and venue.

I have collected all the data from ESPN and crickbuzz and tried to show it in better and easiest way.
