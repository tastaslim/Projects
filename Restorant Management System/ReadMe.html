    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>This is a basic Python Gui Website which is used to calculate all the prices of food ordered by a customer along with taxes and all. Moreover, this contains a menu page as well to show the prices of all available foods. I made this project using tkinter
        and various python libraries such as time to display current local time and all.</p>
    <p>
        This is a simple project which was given to me as my academic task in 2nd year when we were learning python. This project does not include any backend part such as database and all.
